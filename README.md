# RE8FOV
Resident Evil 8 Village: Field of View changing tool.

This tool allows users to change their FoV without modifying the game's executable by writing the two single-precision floating point values that control normal FOV and ads (aim down sight) FOV.

Usage: re8fov.exe <normal fov> <ads fov>
Example: re8fov.exe 110 95
  This would change your FOV to 110 for normal camera and 95 for aiming down the sights.
